## Care for Flora and Fauna

Make sure you have yarn installed in your system. If not install it from here: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

Then in the project directory, run:

### `yarn install`

You can then run:

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
